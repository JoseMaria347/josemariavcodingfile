      Hello, Iâ€™m a Hispanic male from Puerto Rico ponce Named Josemaria, and want to be a Solar/Electrical Installer with coder skills to pay the bills. I love joking around by the way, so myself can do I can help people save money on their electrical bills. Also, I can make a website for a low price. That sounds like a commercial. I hope that I can make a difference in Puerto Rico by installing solar panels and farming (something ) for my people in Ponce when my family and I go to Puerto Rico every two summers. It bothers me they are people who have a lot of space on their land and choose to do nothing with it even though in Puerto Rico, there are a lot of hurricanes and stuff that block traffic and freezes society and close supermarkets, and stop the electrical grid when I will have the power to help them with both electricity and feeding them achieve a put of life that I hope I can achieve.
